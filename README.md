## About Me

I currently work on digital transformation projects where I use insights gained from data to improve and automate business processes. 

My educational background is in Electronics and Computer Systems and studied programming. After working many years in IT in various areas including Application development, Business Analysis and Transformation, I decided to revisit my skills in Data Analytics, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, which are very relevant to my work.

I use data science projects to sharpen my skills and discover various ways to use what I learn in my job. I am active Kaggler and do pet-projects in my spare time to discover new areas.
